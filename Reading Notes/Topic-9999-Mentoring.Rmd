This is a note that I make from conversation with Thomas, an executive director 
at Amgen with 20+ years experience in biopharmaceutical industry.


## July 2020

  Question I asked: What is good for career development? Is clinical trial experience more important than design itself?
  
  Thomas gave a 3-dimensional viewpoint
  
    a. Disease area (e.g., Oncology, inflammation, cadiovascular)
    b. Drug development 
    c. Statistical design, conduct, DMC, filing 
  
  If I want to be more competitive in the job market, I need to experience lots trial aspects. He talked about the evolvement of Design and Innovation within Amgen. I begin to think my job may not be as important as it appears if I decide to pursue external opportunities.  

## June 2020
  Mentoring is
  
  a. generally confidential
  b. about career development
  
  Advice from Thomas
  
  + Don't think your effort will pay you back; Always think about yourself
  + hard work does not guarantee your success, learn to sell yourself
  + understand what makes you happy at work
