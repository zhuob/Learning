This is a note that I make from conversation with Thomas, an executive director 
at Amgen with 20+ years experience in biopharmaceutical industry.

## June 2020
  Mentoring is
  
  a. generally confidential
  b. about career development
  
  Advice from Thomas
  
  + Don't think your effort will pay you back; Always think about yourself
  + hard work does not guarantee your success, learn to sell yourself
  + understand what makes you happy at work
