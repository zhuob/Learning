There are three main recommendation systems:


# Content-based

 predicts what a user like based on what that user like in the past.
 
 + Pros
    + No need for data on other users
    + Able to recommend to users with unique tastes
    + able to recommend new & unpopular items
        + no first rate problem
    + Explanations for recommended items
      + content features that caused an item to be recommended
  
  + Cons
    + finding the appropriate feature is hard
        + e.g., images, movies, music
    + Overspecialization
        + never recommends items outside users content profile
        + people might have multiple interests
        + Unaable to exploit quality judgment of other users
    + Code-start problem for new users
        + how to build a user profile?
    
# Collaborative 

predict what a particular user like based on what other similar users like
     
  + user-user filtering
  + item-item filtering.
  + Usually, item-item filtering is better than user-user filtering (people's tastes are different). 
  + use cosine distance to measure similarity, with centered rating values.

pros/Cons of collaborative filtering

  + works for any kind of item
  + no feature selection needed
  
  Cons: 
  
   + cold start
     + Need enough users in the system to find a match.
   + Sparsity: 
     + the user/ratings matrix is sparse
     + hard to find users that have rated the same items
    
  + first rater 
    + cannot recommend an unrated item 
    + new items, esoteric items.
  
  + Popularity bias
    + tends to recommend popular items. (Harry Potter Effect)
    
# Hybrid Methods
 Add content-based methods to collaborative filtering
