Note for work 

In this repository, I keep notes on what I read from machine learning materials. 

The Chrome extension GitHub with [MathJax] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima]) is a very good tool to view the math formulas in the Rmarkdown file.
